<p>The story I have chosen for this project, is about how I decided where I was going to get my hair cut. I chose this story because, it seems like it would have a larger array of data types for me to try to code then my last story.</p>
<p>Today I relized that I need a hair cut but, I just moved to a new area and am unsure where to go. I have decided that I don't want to spend more than 16$ on a hair cut. I have also decided that I will base my dicision on reviews writtien on Angies list
